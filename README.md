# ICMR Antimicrobial Resistance
Date : 05-02-2025


## Description

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, evolve to resist the effects of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. This growing issue makes infections harder to treat and increases the risk of severe illness, complications, and death. As pathogens continue to develop resistance, many common antibiotics become ineffective, posing significant challenges to public health and modern medicine. Addressing AMR requires global efforts, including responsible antibiotic use, infection prevention, and promoting research for new treatments.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health challenge in India, exacerbated by the country's high burden of infectious diseases and substantial antibiotic consumption. In 2019, AMR was associated with approximately 4.95 million deaths globally, with 1.27 million directly attributed to drug-resistant infections. Notably, a significant portion of these deaths occurred in India, underscoring the severity of the issue within the country

This project mainly focuses on the Data analysis on AMR. Data was collected from the official Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website.
